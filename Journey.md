# My Programming Journey

## 2020
I was introduced to the Delphi IDE and started learning Pascal in Delphi during COVID-19. I made my first TicTacToe in Delphi.

## 2021
I loved playing Minecraft and computational Readstone. So I learned a lot about low-level systems and different number systems. I watched tutorials and explanation videos to understand these systems. I eventually made my own hexadecimal computer with minimal instructions and various other circuits.

## 2022
I discovered Python and started learning it and using it as my main programming language. I also got an Arduino and was introduced to a type of C programming.

## 2023
I made my own scripting language in Python. It taught me so much about general programming and how computers, compilers, and interpreters work. This taught me by far the most about computers and programming.

- Participated in the [Programming Olympiad](https://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/) and went on to Round 2, and ended up 3rd in the province.

## 2024
This was a discovery year for me. I discovered Rust, and it quickly became my favourite programming language. I also looked into C, C++, and C#, but none of these really stuck.

- Participated in the [Programming Olympiad](https://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/) and went on to Round 2, and ended up 1st in the province.

## 2025
I made and published my first Rust crate, [minmath](https://crates.io/crates/minmath), on crates.io. It's just a simple mathematical library that I used to learn Linear Algebra. I also looked at and played a bit with Go and created [GoNAS](https://github.com/Jodus-Melodus/GoNAS), a simple NAS for my home. I created my own rasterizer in Rust based on a Coding Adventure of Sebastian Lague. This inspired me to revisit C and C++, and I made a rasterizer in both to learn them.
