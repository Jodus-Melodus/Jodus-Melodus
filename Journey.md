# My Programming Journey

## 2020
- I was first introduced to the Delphi IDE and began learning Pascal during the COVID-19 lockdown.  
- As my very first project, I built a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in Delphi.  

## 2021
- I spent a lot of time playing Minecraft, where I became fascinated with computational Redstone.  
- This interest led me to explore low-level systems and number systems in depth.  
- I watched countless tutorials and explanatory videos to better understand how these systems worked.  
- Eventually, I built my own hexadecimal computer with minimal instructions, along with several other circuits.  

## 2022
- I discovered Python and quickly adopted it as my main programming language.  
- Around the same time, I was introduced to C programming through Arduino projects.  

## 2023
- I created my own scripting language in Python. This project gave me a deep understanding of programming fundamentals and how computers, compilers, and interpreters work. It remains the single project that taught me the most about programming.  
- I participated in the [Programming Olympiad](https://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/), advanced to Round 2, and placed **3rd in the province**.  

## 2024
This was a year of discovery and growth. I came across Rust, which quickly became my favorite programming language. I also explored C, C++, and C#, but none of them resonated with me the way Rust did.  

- I participated in the [Programming Olympiad](https://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/), advanced to Round 2, and placed **1st in the province**.  

## 2025
- I published my first Rust crate, [minmath](https://crates.io/crates/minmath), a simple mathematical library I created while learning Linear Algebra.  
- I experimented with Go and built [GoNAS](https://github.com/Jodus-Melodus/GoNAS), a simple NAS for my home.  
- Inspired by Sebastian Lagueâ€™s *Coding Adventure* series, I implemented a software rasterizer in Rust.  
- Wanting to deepen my knowledge further, I revisited C and C++ by implementing rasterizers in both.  
- I once again participated in the [Programming Olympiad](https://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/), advanced to Round 2, and placed **1st in the province**.
